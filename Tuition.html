      <p> Any level, any age, any ability. Learn Russian and widen your horizons!</p>
      <p>Students: Russian is recognised as a challenging and relevant subject, and we have a 100% A*- B pass rate across GCSE and A-level, meaning you will be studying with the very best teachers and can expect to gain a valuable addition to your qualification portfolio.</br></p>

      <p>Children: our child friendly lessons are fun and highly interactive; indeed the best time to learn is early when learning a language can develop transferable skills, giving children a head start in other subjects.</br></p>

      <p>Adults: Our one-to-one classes give 100% contact time with the teacher, allowing you to improve your understanding much more effectively by providing a structured and personalised session to suit you. Alternatively learning in a group is a fun and social way to get plenty of speaking practice whilst still having an expert on hand to clarify and explain any questions you may have.</br></p>
      <p>Learn topics that are modern, useable and relevant, for example how to communicate in practical situations such as in the airport or in a restaurant, or learn to communicate professionally with your Russian colleagues with our corporate courses.</p>
